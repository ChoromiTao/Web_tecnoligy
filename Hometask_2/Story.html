    <p>Be still, my love
        I will return to you
        However far you feel from me
        You are not alone
        I will always be waiting
        And I'll always be watching you
        Speak to me, speak to me, speak to me...
        
        I can't let go
        You're every part of me
        The space between is just a dream
        You will never be alone
        I will always be waiting
        And I'll always be watching
        
        We are one breath apart, my love
        And I'll be holding it in 'till we're together
        Hear me call your name
        And just speak, speak to me, speak to me, speak...
        
        I feel you rushing all through me
        In these walls I still hear your heartbeat
        And nothing in this world can hold me back
        From breaking through to you
        
        We are one breath apart, my love
        And I'll be holding it in 'till we're together
        Hear me call your name
        Just believe and speak, speak to me, speak to me...
        
        Be still, my love
        I will return to you...</p>
